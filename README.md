# Guess-the-color
This is a color guessing game .
It shows you a RGB value from rgb(0,0,0) to rgb(255,255,255). 
You need to find the exact color in provided choice of 6 options in case of Hard mode or 3 options in case of Easy mode.
I made this using html, css, js.
I deployed this in heroku and that link is provided above.
